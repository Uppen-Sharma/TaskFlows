1. Dashboard Tests (Views)

These tests ensure that the main application screens render correct data and respond to user interactions properly.

| Test File                 | Source File                    | What Was Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AdminDashboard.test.jsx` | `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` | (TFT-10) Confirmed that the Manager dashboard correctly calculates Total Tasks (mocked as 2), renders the employee list (Alice, Bob), and opens the Create New Task modal when the button is clicked. |
| `UserDashboard.test.jsx`  | `src/pages/UserDashboard.jsx`  | (TFT-9) Verified that an Employee sees only their own statistics (Total Assigned, In Process) and their assigned tasks (e.g., *Fix Login Bug*).                                                               |

The warning shown in `AdminDashboard` about a `value` prop without an `onChange` handler is caused by the Search Bar input.
Because the data hook was mocked, the input became read-only during the test.
This is a React warning only, not a test failure—the test suite still passed successfully.

2. Component Tests (UI Elements)

These tests validate individual UI components and their conditional behavior.

| Test File                    | Source File                                           | What Was Verified                                                                                                                                           |
| -----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TaskItem.test.jsx`          | `src/features/tasks/components/TaskItem.jsx`          | (TFT-13) Confirmed conditional rendering of control buttons: START appears when a task is *pending*, and STOP appears when a task is *running*. |
| `TaskEditModal.test.jsx`     | `src/features/tasks/components/TaskEditModal.jsx`     | (TFT-15) Verified that the modal opens with the correct task data pre-filled and that clicking Save submits the updated task details correctly.     |
| `TaskAccordionList.test.jsx` | `src/features/tasks/components/TaskAccordionList.jsx` | (TFT-11) Confirmed that when filtering returns no results, a “No tasks found” message is shown instead of an empty UI.                              |
| `LoginRegister.test.jsx`     | `src/features/auth/LoginRegister.jsx`                 | (TFT-6) Verified that users can type into Username/Password fields and toggle between Sign In and Create Account modes.                         |

3. Logic & Security Tests (Core Logic)

These tests validate business rules, calculations, and access control without involving UI rendering.

| Test File                          | Source File                                           | What Was Verified                                                                                                                              |
| -----------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useTaskTimeCalculations.test.jsx` | `src/features/tasks/hooks/useTaskTimeCalculations.js` | (TFT-14) Confirmed that tasks with negative remaining time are flagged as `isTimeExpired: true` and displayed with the “(Over)” label. |
| `authSlice.test.js`                | `src/features/auth/authSlice.js`                      | (TFT-5) Verified Redux state handling by ensuring all user data is cleared when `logoutUser` is dispatched.                                |
| `ProtectedRoute.test.jsx`          | `src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.jsx`            | (TFT-7) Confirmed route protection by redirecting unauthenticated users attempting to access `/protected` back to the Login page.          |
